# ExampleBrains

Congratulations, you've found the example_brains repo for [mustached-nemesis](https://github.com/KevinMcHugh/mustached-nemesis). this repo is a gem featuring a handful of different brains to get you started in developing your own brain. You can also use these brains as fodder for your own,
more sophisticated brain. 

## The Brains

* The [Attack Left Brain](https://github.com/KevinMcHugh/example_brains/blob/master/lib/example_brains/attack_left_brain.rb): Always attacks to the left.
* The [Attack Right Brain](https://github.com/KevinMcHugh/example_brains/blob/master/lib/example_brains/attack_right_brain.rb)
* The [Murder Brain](https://github.com/KevinMcHugh/example_brains/blob/master/lib/example_brains/murder_brain.rb): Tries to murder the weakest player
* The [Plays All Possible Cards Brain](https://github.com/KevinMcHugh/example_brains/blob/master/lib/example_brains/plays_all_possible_cards_brain.rb): Uses all its cards. Surprisingly effective.
* The [Mildly Intelligent Brain](https://github.com/KevinMcHugh/example_brains/blob/master/lib/example_brains/mildly_intelligent_brain.rb): Intelligent targetting and card use. Unsurprisingly effective.
